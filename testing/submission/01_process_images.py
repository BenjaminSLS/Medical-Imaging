# Our group decided that using the 01 and 02 file was not worth it. Instead we decided to combine these two scripts in the model.py and also lesion.py.
# Instead of taking a functional approach to the solution, we decided to take an object oriented approach. This allowed us to easily add new features to the lesion class and also to the model class.
